June and July (with poets)
==========================

I spent June and July
in a wild social-artistic frenzy
between web clients.

Curious about the academic writing scene,
and wanting to push my work in new ways,
I registed for overlapping intensive
classes and conferences,
while simultaneously working on new material
for *Leon Presents a Reading Series #6*
(with Dan |&| Sondra),
and sorting out the details of a new contract.

It was too much and more,
but a blast all the same.

E-Poetry: The Past, Present and Future of Electronic Poetry
-----------------------------------------------------------

At the end of may
I was honored to participate
in this wonderful e-poetry event
hosted by `Aaron Angello`_,
`Erin Costello`_,
and `SpringGun Press`_
at `Counterpath Press`_.

Besides being a great event,
it was an opportunity to meet
more of the Denver writing scene:

- Michael Flatt
- Derrick Mundd
- Mathias Svalina
- J. Michael Martinez
- Oren Silverman

Naropa Summer Writing Program
-----------------------------

Naropa is a funny place,
but founded at the core of the beat poetry movement,
they take their writing seriously.
At times disgustingly earnest
and obsesed with new-age catch-phrases
stripped of meaning through overuse
(cultural rhizome, temporary autonomous zone, etc.),
The program was also inspiring and informative.

My classes were fantastic:

- *Remembering Dismemberment, Dismembering Rememberment* with `E. Tracy Grinnell`_
- *Preparing for Obsolesence* with `Michelle Ellsworth`_
- *Embodying a Figure* with `Caroline Bergvall`_

.. _E. Tracy Grinnell:

and/or saw perform:

- Tiara Lopez
- HR Hegnauer
- Emily K. Harrison
- Selah Ann Saterstrom
- Bhanu Kapil
- Rachel Melville
- Sarah Sinclair Stockholm
- Taylor Quilty
