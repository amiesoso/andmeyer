Fuck the Muse: A Blog Mini-Series
=================================

I was planning to spend the next month
teaching `a class`_ with the
`Boulder Writers' Workshop`_.
That class didn't fill,
but we've had lots of interest,
so I'm going to explore some of the themes right here
in a six-part *Fuck the Muse* blog mini-series.

The goal of this series is simple:

  Take control of your creative process,
  to create unexpected art that moves an audience.

There's a myth that creativity can't be taught,
but I believe we've been looking at it wrong.
You can't teach a sudden moment of inspiration,
but those moments don't occur in a vaccum:
they come from a process.
Artists aren't born with inspiration built in,
they learn to build it one piece at a time,
and then they collate the results for everyone to see.

I'm not interested in a theoretical or academic approach.
I'm interested in making good art.
I believe everyone can make good art if they learn how,
and everyone can make better art if they practice.

This isn't some feel-good new-age express-yourself bullshit.
I don't care if you feel like you've expressed something deep and personal.
I want you to tear your creation apart,
hate it, and struggle with it.
I want you to bring an audience along for the ride,
and convince them love/hate it as much as you do.

It's time to do away with our notions of "creativity"
as a single moment,
and start to fucus on the creative process.

Life after "creativity"
-----------------------

Leaving creativity behind,
frees us to make the art,
and make it better:

- **Ease the burden of originality.**
  The pressure to be original and interesting works against you.
  Don't try to be interesting.
  Set up the necessary conditions,
  and then make sure you capture the results.
- **Make informed decisions.**
  If you aren't tied to the outcome of your creative experiments,
  you can consider all the options
  (even the crazy ones).
- **Do the unthinkable.**
  The only way to create something unimaginable
  is to get outside your own imagination.
- **Put your strengths (and weeknesses) to use.**
  Disecting the process allows you to take stock of your skills.
  From there you can tailor to your strengths,
  and put your weeknesses to use as a creative force of their own.

With all your options open,
the art you create can be anything.
Genre and medium become secondary -
expressions of the art,
without any importance of their own.
You could end up writing Genre Fiction,
or find yourself performing
abstract interpretive movement,
covered with horse entrails
in the basement of a church.

It's up to you.

The 5-step program
------------------

There are five major steps to accomplish
along the way to any creative product:

1. Seed (Idea/Question/Hypothesis)
2. Explore (Gather/Create)
3. Organize
4. Draft
5. Revise

Every creative project goes through some variation
on these five steps.
It's not a matter of following the directions,
one step after the other,
but understanding the terrain
so you can orient yourself if you get lost,
and select your own best rout from there.

Our plan is to look at each step of the process
and discuss the tools we can use to complete that step.
Those tools should help us overcome any number of obstacles,
from simple "writer's block"
to the more difficult task of breaking our habits
and pushing past the obvious.

Credit where due (sometimes)
----------------------------

There is no way to find and list all my influences,
but I'll do what I can:

This approach is influenced most heavily by
Anne Bogart's `Viewpoints`_,
Chuck Mee's `(re)making project`_,
`The LIDA Project's`_ "bucketing",
`Lean`_ and `Agile`_ web development,
standard graphic design techniques,
`scientific method`_,
`Steal Like An Artist`_ by Austin Kleon,
`Everything is a Remix`_ by Kirby Ferguson,
and many years of working with ensemble theatres and bands.
I recently found Don Fry's
`Writing Your Way`_,
which uses the same basic steps.
Now I borrow from him as well.
