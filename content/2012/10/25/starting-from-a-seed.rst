Part 01: Define the Seed
========================

Every step in our process starts with a question.
Once you can answer the question,
it's time to move to the next step.
To get started, we have to know:

  "What am I trying to do, build, or explore?"

You can't start working
until you know what you are working towards.
That doesn't mean knowing all the answers,
it means knowing the questions that will guide you.

There are many ways to find,
define, and refine your seed:
Scientific Method and Viewpoints
both start with a question.
Scientific Method and The LIDA Project
go on to state a hypothesis.
Simon Sinek, on the other hand,
starts with "why" and then "how" -
statements of belief and values.
These are all variations on a seed:
an idea that you plant and cultivate
in order to grow your final product.

Let's get started.

Inspiration |&| Perspiration
----------------------------

Any artist can tell you that creativity
requires a unique mix of work and play.
John Cleese, in his 1991 `lecture on creativity`_,
describes two modes of operating:
an "open" playful mode,
and a "closed" productive more.

Creative people, he claims,
are simply the people that
cultivate the open mode of operating.

  But, let me make one thing quite clear.
  We need to be in the open mode when we're pondering a problem,
  but once we come up with a solution,
  we must then switch to the closed mode to implement it.

Renowned psychiatrist Iain McGilchrist
uses the same words to discribe
the right and left hemispheres of the brain
in his `Divided Brain lecture`_ to the `RSA`_:

  The right hemisphere gives sustained,
  broad, open, vigilant alertness
  where the left hemisphere gives narrow,
  sharply-focussed attention to detail.

He explains that all animals have this divide,
but humans have one thing more —
the frontal lobe —
which acts as an inhibitor,
giving us the ability to step back.

  Let me make it very clear,
  for imagination you need both hemispheres.

I see these two "modes"
and the ability to move between them
as the key to a successful creative process.
The work happens in cycles:

* Open |&| Closed
* Active |&| Reflective
* Expanding |&| Contracting

Whenever I get stuck,
my first reaction is to move
from one mode to the other.
Keep the cycle going.
