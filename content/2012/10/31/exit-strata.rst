Exit Strata: Battlefield Notes
==============================

The multimedia arts (`non`_)magazine,
`Exit Strata`_ has asked to cross post
my `creative process mini-series`_.
I'm honored. Thank you, Exit Strata.
We started with a brief
`introduction to my work`_.

They accept comments over there as well,
so we'll make things as interactive as possible.
Feel free to read along,
or join in the conversation at any point.
I'm happy to answer questions,
go on tangents,
dispute semantic minutia,
and otherwise be influenced by your thoughts.

Let's do this!
