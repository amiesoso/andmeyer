Foundation and Frontmatter
==========================

Six months ago we completed
a `RocketHub campaign`_
with your help.
Since then
We've been editing,
sketching,
adjusting,
coding,
testing,
designing,
and coding some more.

I'm happy to say
we've reached a milestone.
The foundation is complete,
the frontmatter is styled,
and from here on out we are working
page by page and chapter by chapter
to bring everything together.

Getting Things Done
-------------------

In that time I found a new job,
went to a million conferences,
moved into a `new house`_,
and still managed to get some work done.
For anyone keeping track,
