Hate Your Art
-------------

I pay my rent by designing web applications
as a contractor for hire.
I've been doing that since 2006,
and it can be a very stressful job.
It can be hard to convince clients
that design is not simply a matter of aesthetic preference —
that some designs are actually more effective than others.
On a bad day,
I start to think my job is to argue with clients
and defend my studied choices
against their barage of preferences.
On those days, I want to quit and work in a factory.

But then I catch myself.
My job is not to convince the client that a design works:
my job is to make it work *better*.
No solution is perfect — design is always a matter of tradeoffs.
I need to be the harshest critic of my work,
openly and publically,
so that the client and I are on the same team,
solving problems together.
That moves the focus of critique off of me as a designer,
and onto the design itself.

OddBird now has regular client meetings
where we simply go around the circle and talk about
what isn't working.
I always go first,
and explain the tradeoffs that I've made,
and why I'm not entirely happy with them.
Once I've done that,
it's very rare that the client can even think of any additional complaints.
The tension is gone, along with the conflict.
The client is not my enemy, the design is.

I find the same process to be helpful in any creative project.
The audience is not my adversary.
Neither are my collaborators.
The work is my enemy,
and my most important job is to find all the flaws,
and then fix them.

Your job as an artist
is to hate the work enough that you can fix it.

Love Your Self
--------------

You are not the work.
Your cretions, as much as they mean to you,
do not reflect on you as a person.
The same way everyone learns to differentiate themselves
from the people around them
(especially lovers),
artists need to differentiate from their art.

When I started to do theatre,
my uncle warned me about reviews.
His advice was simple:
you can read the reviews,
but you can't take them personally, for better or worse.
The positive reviews are not about you,
and the negative reviews aren't either.
Sometimes a reviewer will see what you didn't,
or they will fail to see what you did.
You may learn something,
but it has absolutely nothing to do with you and your skill.

You are not the work.
Step outside it, and look in.
you know it has problems, every piece does.
Write yourself a review of your work.
Tear it apart.
Then let go.

Judgemental Brainstorming
-------------------------

|campbell|

In the 1960's,
psychologist `Donald Campbell`_ proposed
a theory of creative thought based on a process he called
*blind variation and selective retention*.
The first part
refers to a process of idea generation
that isn't concerned about the utility of each idea.
Those are the `shitty piles of shit`_ we've been talking about.

But there's another side to that process,
because simple `brainstorming doesn't work`_,
"No wrong answers" ignores the importance of critical thought.
It's not good enough to blindly generate ideas —
we also have to critique those ideas,
debate them,
and push deeper.
The ability to criticize your ideas as they come
helps you generate more (and better) ideas.
That's *selective retention*.

It's good to generate ideas blindly,
but once they exist,
it's best to debate them critically.
