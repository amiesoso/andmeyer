From Suck to Non-Suck
---------------------

I pay my rent by designing web applications for clients.
I've been doing that since 2006,
and it can be a stressful job.
On a bad day,
I think my job is to argue with clients —
defending my well-researched decisions against uninformed opinion.
On those days I want to quit and work in a factory.

On those days I'm wrong.
My job is not to convince client that the design works already:
my job is to make it work *better*.
The best work doesn't happen in a vacuum —
`it requires a critique and change`_.

To avoid this problem at OddBird,
we've adapted a a process that is often credited to `Pixar`_ —
meeting regularly to critique our own work —
with clients in the room.
No complaint is too small,
and everything gets debate.
The goal, as `Pixar's President explains it`_,
is "going from suck to non-suck".

You have to start somewhere,
and wherever you start is bound to suck.
Your job as an artist
is to hate the work enough that you can fix it.

Fail More: You'll be Fine
-------------------------

`This American Life`_ host Ira Glass
has some advice for young artists,
but helpful for everyone:

He's talking about the growth of every artist,
but the same is true for the growth of every project.

It doesn't matter how good your work is right now.
If it's not done, keep fighting with it.
The point of `high standards`_ isn't that you always meet them,
it's that you keep pushing.

.. _high standards: http://www.psmag.com/culture-society/the-two-faces-of-perfectionism-8137/

Every success will come from a string of failures,
and that's just fine.

Remember, you are not the work.
Your cretions, as much as they mean to you,
are not you.
When the work sucks,
that doesn't mean you suck,
it means you still have some work to do.
Stand back and consider the piece from a distance —
what's working and what isn't.
Then go watch a movie,
read a book,
take a bath,
get laid,
eat some ice cream,
or whatever you do to take care of yourself.
