Part 01: Define the Seed
========================

Every step in our process starts with a question.
Once you can answer the question,
it's time to move to the next step.
To get started, we have to know:

  "What am I trying to do, build, or explore?"

You can't start working
until you know what you are working towards.
That doesn't mean knowing all the answers,
it means knowing the questions that will guide you.

There are many ways to find,
define, and refine your seed:
Scientific Method and Viewpoints
both start with a question.
Scientific Method and The LIDA Project
go on to state a hypothesis.
Simon Sinek, on the other hand,
starts with "why" and then "how" -
statements of belief and values.
These are all variations on a seed:
an idea that you plant and cultivate
in order to grow your final product.

Let's get started.
