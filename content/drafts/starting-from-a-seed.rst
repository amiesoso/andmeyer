Part 01: Define the Seed
========================

  "What's the driving force behind this project?"

You can't start working
until you know what you are working towards.
That doesn't mean knowing all the answers,
it means knowing the questions that will guide you.

I refer to that guiding question as
the "seed" of a project.

A Range of Specimen
-------------------

There are many ways to find,
define, and refine your seed.
Scientific Method
starts with a question
and goes on to state a hypothesis.

The LIDA Project uses question and hypothesis,
and adds what they call
"the bicycle" —
a rough idea of how to approach the question.
It's called the bicycle because it is the mode of transport,
and because half the process is learning how to ride it.

Anne Bogart covers similar territory
with her seeds:
The question,
the anchor,
and the structure.
The question motivates the work,
the anchor is a person or event
through which we view the question,
and the structure gives us a framework to build on.

Simon Sinek starts his projects with
"why" then "how" and finally "what" -
statements of belief, values, and finally product.
Mashup artists start with two existing pieces,
and conceptual artists often start by combining ideas or genres.

These are all variations on a seed:
an idea that you plant and cultivate
in order to grow your final product.

Germinating
-----------

My seeds usually start with one idea
that I research and play with
until other ideas attach themselves.
I find questions,
hypothesis, anchors, bicycles, and the rest
along the way.

One of my current projects-in-development
started with a quote I read:

  We name and speak of a troublesome ‘transsexualism,’ the feeling of being the other sex… We do not name and talk much about the feeling of being the same sex— the sex we think we are, the sex most of us desire to stay. But does not our feeling relatively comfortable with our sex, and our intense desire to maintain the integrity of our sex, indicate something that needs to be explained?

Around the same time,
I read a scientific article about research
on out-of-body experiences.
It turns out,
they're easy to create in a lab.
I started compiling a set of questions:

- What does it mean to identify with a sex or gender?
- How do we relate to these bodies we are in?
- How are trauma and memory involved?

To make it a hypothesis I might say:
Our concepts of self and body boundaries
are driven by our need to make narrative sense of the world.
That doesn't excite me as an actionable theory to explore on it's own,
but it does lead me towards a structure.

With the motivating "why" in place,
I turned to history and mythology for the anchors, the "how".
I settled on the transformation of Hermaphroditus,
combining it with Mother Clap's 18th-century Molly House,
and a supporting cast from the songs of Lou Reed and Tom Waits.

For my structure/bicycle,
I decided to explore the construction of narrative.
If memory comes to us in fragments,
why not explore it in the same way?
The structure would include elements of narrative
(repeated themes, characters, and events)
but without the connective glue.
In the end, the fragments can be shuffled
and read in any order.
