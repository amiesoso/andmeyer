Tools of Creative Summoning
===========================

We're still `working our way`_ through
the `curiosity shopping lists`_
we created several weeks ago.
This is still step 2 in the
`overall creative process`_,
but it's a large step.
This is where we
*find or create all the material*.

We're trying to gather enough material
to organize (step 3) into a rough draft (step 4).

Judgemental Brainstorming
-------------------------

In the 1960's,
psychologist Donald Campbell proposed
a theory of creative thought based on a process he called
blind variation and selective retention.
The first part, blind variation,
refers to a process of idea generation
that isn't concerned about the utility of each idea.
The goal is to have more ideas to choose from,
even if most of them are thrown out later.

It sounds a bit like brainstorming.
The problem is,
`brainstorming doesn't work`_,
because it ignores the role of criticism
as an essential ingredient.
It's not good enough to bindly generate ideas,
we also have to test those ideas,
debate them,
and throw away the bad ones.
That's selective retention part.

The goal is to hold both ideas in mind at once,
generating ideas without concern for their utility,
and then immediately poking and prodding those ideas
to see if they are worth follow-up.
The ability to criticize your ideas,
it turns out,
helps you generate more (and better) ideas.

Blind Variation
---------------

  Take a tune, sing high when they sing low,
  sing fast when they sing slow,
  and you’ve got a new tune.

  *— Woody Guthrie*

Conceptual artists are masters of blind variation,
and everyone should learn from their process.
The tools available are endless,
but always boil down to a simple setup:
a list of ingredients, and an algorythm for manipulating them.

Mary Overlie developed a terminology of "viewpoints"
for looking at dance as a collection of its parts,
similar to the "elements and principles of design"
used by many visual artists.
She started with
Space, Story, Time, Emotion, Movement, and Shape.
Anne Bogart's and Tina Landau expanded on the list for theatre,
breaking them into groups:

- Time: Tempo, Duration, Kinesthetic Response, and Repetition.
- Space: Shape, Gesture, Architecture, Spatial Relationship, and Topography.
- Vocal: Pitch, Dynamic, and Timbre.

These overlapp with the elements and principles of design
(again, different people use different lists):

- Elements: Line, Shape, Direction, Size, Texture, Color, and Value.
- Principles: Balance, Gradation, Repetition, Contrast, Harmony, Dominance, and Unity.

It's not important that these lists be perfect or complete,
what matters is that we can use them to generate ideas.
Explore each viewpoint to see what happens —
faster, slower, longer, shorter, etc.
Without much work, you can start to create your own "creative"
algorythms for idea generation
by manipulating viewpoints based on other criteria.
you can use mathmatical manipulations,
chance operations,
or just follow your gut.

I've not seen any similar lists for writers,
but I imagine there would be a fair overlapp again.
I'd love to see what people come up with.

Selective Retention
-------------------

The ideas are being generated without judgement,
but as soon as they exist, it's time to tear them apart.
Which ideas are working, and why?
How can you use that knowledge to generate better ideas?
Don't worry about backtracking.
If an idea looked promising but doesn't bear any fruit,
ditch it and go back.

There is no one right answer,
but there are a million wrong answers,
and it's your job to weed them out.

At `OddBird` we have regular meetings just to critique what we did
the day before.
We go around the (virtual) room asking simply:
What's bothering you?
What isn't working?
This changed everything in the way I was able to relate to clients,
and it changed how we felt about the product.

We started finding better solutions to problems,
because we weren't willing to settle for the first thing we tried.
I was no longer working against the clients —
trying to convince them that we had a good solution to their problem —
we were working together to root out problems,
determine *why* they were problems,
and find even better solutions.

Getting more negative about our ideas along the way
helps us feel more positive about our final results.

Love on Your Self, Hate on Your Work
------------------------------------

Criticism is an important part of the work,
but it should always stay impersonal.
You are not your ideas, and your ideas don't have feelings.
You are pretty awesome, and most of your ideas will be total bullshit.
Those two things are not related.
