Tools of Creative Summoning
===========================

We're still `working our way`_ through
the `curiosity shopping lists`_
we created several weeks ago.
This is still step 2 in the
`overall creative process`_,
but it's a large step.
This is where we
*find or create all the material*.

Once we have enough material to create a draft,
it will be time to move on
and do exactly that.
