The Complete GreenMud Font Family
=================================

When I began designing
`Into the Green Green Mud`_
I was unhappy with the available
handdrawn fonts.
I'm not a purist —
I would happily pay for an existing solution —
but I am picky,
and I didn't see a font that would work.

That's not because the existing
handdrawn fonts are bad —
several are quite nice —
but there were two things that pushed me
to create my own:

1. Most handdrawn fonts have too much character.
   I don't want my fonts to be so expressive in design,
   I want to leave most of that work to the words,
   images, and imagination.
2. The illustrations have a unified and distinct style,
   with solid, even-width, digitally handdrawn lines.
   There is no attempt to mimic the varrying-widths
   left by a pen, or the inconsistencies of a pencil.
