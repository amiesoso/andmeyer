Blind Variation and Selective Retention
=======================================

|campbell|

In the 1960's,
psychologist `Donald Campbell`_ proposed
a theory of creative thought based on a process he called
*blind variation and selective retention*.

*Blind variation*
means generating ideas
without worrying about the utility of each one.
At some point you have to generate ideas
simply to see what the options are.
Those are the `shitty piles of shit`_ we've been talking about.

But there's another side to that process,
because simple `brainstorming doesn't work`_.
There are wrong answers.
In fact, *most answers are wrong*,
but it's your job to determine which ones and why.
It's not good enough to blindly generate ideas,
we have to critique those ideas,
debate them,
and push deeper.

Your ability to criticize your own ideas as they come
helps you generate more (and better) ideas.
That's *selective retention*.
Keep the best, and throw out the rest,
then start follow the cycle again.

Expand, contract, expand again.

This isn't exactly *editing* yet,
because you don't yet have a full draft to revise.
We're still generating content,
with brief stops along the way
to check the map,
and adjust our course.
