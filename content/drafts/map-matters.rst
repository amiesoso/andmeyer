  Any creative process has to make it through
  the same 5 broad steps.
  Every time I sit down to work on a project,
  I remind myself where I am in the process.
  It's important.
  Not because it tells you what to do,
  but because it tells you where you are.

Why the Map Matters
===================

1. `Define the Seed`_: *What's the idea, question, or hypothesis?*
2. `Explore`_: *Reasearch, gather, and create the materials.*
3. Organize: *Outline the structure, or impose one.*
4. Draft: *Compile a complete first draft.*
5. Revise: *Consider, critique, and edit as needed.*

Any creative process has to make it through
those 5 steps.
Every time I sit down to work on a project,
I remind myself where I am in the process.
It's important.

The creative process can seem a bit fuzzy.
Everyone does some editing
while still exploring & developing new material.
You have to.
You get distracted,
jump around,
make changes as you see the need,
and keep going.

This process isn't about following rules,
or doing it the same way someone else does it.
We'll all use different tools & take different paths,
but we're negotiating the same basic terrain,
and it's helpful to have a map.

The map doesn't tell us what to do,
it tells us where we are & what is around us.
The process is here to free you from fear of getting lost.
You can do anything you want,
but you are only *responsible* for one step at a time.

Right now you are responsible for developing material.
You're not forgetting anything.
It's not too sloppy.
It doesn't matter if you've stolen material you can't keep.
There's a step for cleaning that up later.
Right now you create.
Get to work.
