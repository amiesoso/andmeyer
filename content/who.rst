Coconspirators
--------------

My work wouldn't be possible
without the network of amazing artists
I collaborate with every day.
*Carl Meyer* & *Jonny Gerig Meyer* at Oddbird;
*Daniel Eisenstat* & *Sondra Eby* at Teacup Gorilla;
*Julie Rada* at Vicious Trap;
*Chris Eppstein*, *Danny Palmer*, and many others working on Compass and Susy;
*Jacob Liechty*, *Aaron Liechty*, & *Brandi Homan* in my writing group;
and so on.

Then there are the artists
who inspired & trained me.
*Bruce Hostetler*,
*Dave Nofzinger*,
*Susanne Ehst*,
*Chris Wallace*,
*Eric Good Kaufmann*,
*Bryan Falcon*,
*Don Yost*,
*Merrill Krabill*,
*Jerry Peters*,
*Anne Bogart*,
*Penny Metropulos*,
*Eric Kanagy*,
*Michelle Milne*,
*Chuck Mee Jr*,
*Brian Freeland*,
*E. Tracy Grinnell*,
*Michelle Ellsworth*,
*Caroline Bergvall*,
and so on.

This list is miserably incomplete.
There are many more artists who I've worked with,
learned from,
been inspired by,
and shamelessly ripped off.
Thanks to all of them.
