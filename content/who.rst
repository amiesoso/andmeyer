Then there are the artists
who inspired, trained, and believed in me.
*Bruce Hostetler*,
*Dave Nofzinger*,
*Susanne Ehst*,
*Chris Wallace*,
*Eric Good Kaufmann*,
*Bryan Falcon*,
*Don Yost*,
*Jerry Peters*,
*Eric Kanagy*,
*Michelle Milne*,
*Brian Freeland*,
*E. Tracy Grinnell*,
*Michelle Ellsworth*,
*Caroline Bergvall*,
and so on.

This list is miserably incomplete.
There are many more artists who I've worked with,
learned from,
been inspired by,
and shamelessly ripped off.
Thanks to all of them.
