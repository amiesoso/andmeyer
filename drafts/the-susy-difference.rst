The Susy Difference
===================

I regularly have people asking
about the difference betweeen Susy
and various other grid systems.

Our 'competition' used to be
960gs and Blueprint,
now we are more often compared to
Zurb Foundation
Twitter Bootstrap
Less Framework
Gridsetapp
(which now include support for pre-processors)
or occasionally
Semantic GS
and Zen Grids
(which are also built
primarily for pre-processors).
