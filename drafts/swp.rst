Naropa Summer Writing Program
=============================

Naropa is a funny place,
at times disgustingly earnest
and obsesed with catch-phrases
stripped of meaning through overuse
(cultural rhizome, temporary autonomous zone, etc.),
but the program was inspiring and informative.
My classes were:

- *Remembering Dismemberment, Dismembering Rememberment* with `E. Tracy Grinnell`_.
- *Preparing for Obsolesence* with `Michelle Ellsworth`_.
- *Embodying a Figure* with `Caroline Bergvall`_.

Week 1 helped me give some shape to
"Variations on Riding Side Saddle".
Week 2 produced the unexpected

Another highlight
(among many)
was a reading from "Sir_"
by `HR Hegnauer`_.
