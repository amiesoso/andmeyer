E-Poetry: The Past, Present and Future...
=========================================

I spent the last few months
in a wild social-artistic frenzy.
Curious about the academic writing scene,
and wanting to push my work in new ways,
I registed for overlapping intensive
classes and conferences,
while simultaneously working on new material,
and sorting out the details of a new contract.

It started with an e-poetry conference
here in Denver at the end of May.
The event was hosted at Counterpath_
(which has great poetry events on a regular basis)
by `Aaron Angello`_,
`Erin Costello`_,
and `SpringGun Press`_.

Those links could keep me occupied for hours,
but here are (at least) two more worth following:

- `Amaranth Borsuk <http://www.amaranthborsuk.com/>`_
- `Mark Marino <http://markcmarino.com/>`_

Thanks to Aaron and Erin for the invitation to participate,
and to the great community there for making it so enjoyable.
